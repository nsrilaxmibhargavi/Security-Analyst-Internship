# Task 6 – Research Report on the Importance of Patch Management

This task focuses on understanding why **patch management** is essential in cybersecurity. The goal was to explore how patches protect systems, what happens when organizations fail to apply them, and the best practices for building a strong patching strategy.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Write a detailed report explaining the importance of patch management, the risks of unpatched systems, and the recommended practices for maintaining secure and up-to-date environments.

---

## 📝 What I Did
- Researched how patch management works and why it is a critical cybersecurity function  
- Explained the role patches play in fixing vulnerabilities, improving system stability, and ensuring compliance  
- Covered the major consequences of failing to patch systems, including breaches, ransomware, and downtime  
- Included real-world examples such as the **WannaCry ransomware attack**, which exploited an already-patched Windows vulnerability  
- Documented best practices for effective patch management such as prioritization, automation, testing, and verification  
- Compiled all findings into a structured research report (PDF)

## 📚 Topics Covered in the Report

### **• What Is Patch Management?**
- Identifying, acquiring, testing, and applying patches  
- Its role in reducing vulnerabilities and improving performance  
- Importance for compliance frameworks (ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA)

### **• Consequences of Poor Patch Management**
- Security breaches due to known vulnerabilities  
- Ransomware infections  
- Data theft and reputational damage  
- Service outages and operational downtime  
- Compliance violations and fines  
- Increased supply-chain risk  

### **• Real-World Example**
- **WannaCry (2017)** ransomware outbreak caused by an unpatched Microsoft vulnerability  
- Demonstrated global impact of ignoring critical updates

### **• Best Practices for Effective Patch Management**
- Maintain an asset inventory  
- Prioritize patches based on risk and exposure  
- Test patches before deployment  
- Automate updates where possible  
- Apply critical patches quickly  
- Schedule maintenance windows  
- Continuously monitor and verify patch status  
- Include third-party and firmware patches  
- Document patching procedures and maintain rollback plans

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- Patch management is one of the most important security practices for protecting systems  
- Most major breaches exploit vulnerabilities that already had available patches  
- A strong patching strategy reduces attack surface, improves stability, and supports compliance  
- Automation, prioritization, and verification are crucial for maintaining an effective patch lifecycle
