# Task 5 – Research Report on Social Engineering Attacks

This task focuses on researching **social engineering attacks** that target people rather than technology. The goal was to understand how attackers exploit human psychology through techniques like phishing, pretexting, and baiting, and how organizations can defend against these threats.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Research and document different types of social engineering attacks, provide real-world case studies, and recommend effective prevention and mitigation strategies.

---

## 📝 What I Did
- Researched multiple forms of social engineering used in real-world attacks  
- Explained how each technique works and why it is effective  
- Collected case studies showing the impact on organizations (financial loss, data breaches, espionage)  
- Mapped out technical, organizational, physical, and human-focused defenses  
- Compiled everything into a structured report in PDF/Markdown format

## 📚 Topics Covered in the Report

The report discusses a wide range of social engineering techniques, including:

- **Phishing & Its Variants**
  - Phishing, spear-phishing, whaling  
  - Smishing (SMS), vishing (voice calls), clone phishing  
  - Credential harvesting via fake login pages  

- **Pretexting**
  - Fake HR, bank, or IT support scenarios  
  - Using believable stories to trick victims into sharing sensitive data  

- **Baiting & Quid Pro Quo**
  - Malicious USB drives, infected “free” downloads, fake QR codes  
  - Attackers offering fake “help” or services in exchange for access  

- **Tailgating / Piggybacking & Physical Tricks**
  - Following employees through secure doors  
  - Misusing badges or pretending to carry heavy items  

- **Watering Hole Attacks & Impersonation**
  - Infecting websites trusted by a target group  
  - Fake profiles, spoofed caller IDs, and deepfake voice scams  

- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**
  - CEO fraud, vendor email compromise, fraudulent wire transfers  

- **Other Techniques**
  - Dumpster diving, shoulder surfing, and information harvesting

---

## 📊 Case Studies Included
The report analyzes several real incidents, such as:

- Targeted spear-phishing breach against a security company  
- High-value Business Email Compromise (BEC) causing multi-million losses  
- Watering hole attack on NGO researchers  
- USB baiting in a government office leading to malware spread  
- Deepfake voice scam used to authorize fraudulent transfers  

These examples show how social engineering can bypass technical defenses by going directly after people.

## 🛡️ Prevention & Mitigation (Summary)
The report outlines defenses across four main areas:

- **Technical Controls**
  - MFA, email filtering, URL scanning, SPF/DKIM/DMARC  
  - Disabling USB autorun, endpoint protection, regular patching  

- **Organizational Policies**
  - Verification procedures for payments and data requests  
  - Vendor security checks and strict data handling rules  

- **Physical Security**
  - Badge-based access control, anti-tailgating measures  
  - Secure document disposal and surveillance  

- **Employee Training**
  - Regular awareness sessions and simulated phishing  
  - Encouraging reporting of suspicious activity without blame

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- Social engineering targets **people**, which often makes it more effective than purely technical attacks  
- Phishing, BEC, and impersonation can lead to major financial loss and data breaches  
- A combination of technical controls, strong policies, physical security, and continuous training is essential  
- Building a security-aware culture is the most powerful defense against social engineering
