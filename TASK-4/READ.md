# Task 4 – Research Report on Common Network Security Threats

This task focuses on researching and understanding several major **network security threats**, including DoS/DDoS attacks, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, and spoofing techniques. The goal was to learn how these attacks work, their real-world impact, and what defenses can be used to prevent them.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Write a detailed research report explaining common network security threats, their mechanisms, real-world examples, and effective mitigation strategies.

---

## 📝 What I Did
- Conducted research on major network-level attacks such as DoS/DDoS, MITM, and spoofing  
- Explained how each attack works at a technical level  
- Described the impact these attacks have on confidentiality, integrity, and availability  
- Included multiple real-world examples to show how these attacks occur in practice  
- Documented practical defensive measures, industry standards, and mitigation techniques  
- Compiled everything into a well-structured report in PDF/Markdown format

---

## 📚 Topics Covered in the Report
The final report includes detailed sections on:

### **• Denial-of-Service (DoS) & Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks**
- Volumetric, protocol, and application-layer attacks  
- Real-world example: 2016 Mirai botnet attack  
- Mitigation: rate limiting, load balancing, CDNs, DDoS protection services  

### **• Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**
- ARP poisoning, rogue hotspots, SSL stripping  
- Real-world example: Superfish certificate incident  
- Mitigation: HTTPS, VPNs, HSTS, certificate validation, DNSSEC  

### **• Spoofing Attacks**
- IP spoofing, ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, and email spoofing  
- Their role in larger attacks (DoS, MITM, phishing)  
- Mitigation: packet filtering, SPF/DKIM/DMARC, DNSSEC, static ARP entries  

### **• Additional Threats**
- Session hijacking  
- Ransomware propagation  
- Port scanning & reconnaissance  
- Zero-day exploits in network-facing services

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- Network threats exploit weaknesses in communication, trust, and protocol design  
- MITM, spoofing, and DoS attacks can severely impact availability, privacy, and integrity  
- A layered defense approach (firewalls, encryption, IDS/IPS, segmentation, user awareness) is essential  
- Real-world incidents show how quickly these attacks can escalate without proper protection
